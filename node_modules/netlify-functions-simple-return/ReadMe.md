# Netlify Functions Simple Return

To return JSON from a Netlify Function, you have to return a `statusCode` as well as a JSON string (not JSON directly). This is a little inconvenient, so this packages simplifies the return so that you don't have to stringify the JSON directly.

## How to Use

Instead of this...

```javascript
exports.handler = () => {
    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({ msg: 'Hello World' }),
    };
};
```

Do this...

```javascript
const simpleReturn = require('netlify-functions-simple-return');
exports.handler = () => {
    return simpleReturn(200, { msg: 'Hello World' });
};
```

This becomes more helpful as you add more potential returns in your Serverless Function.
